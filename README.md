# DeepAR-torch
This is a pytorch-based implementation of DeepAR ([DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04110)).

Based on the works of [TimeSeries](https://github.com/zhykoties/TimeSeries), this implementation is developed to provide more easy-reading API for training and testing single variable as well as multi-variable time sries.
